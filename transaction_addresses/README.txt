addressFiller.py is a python script designed to populate addresses from acipayments inc

assumptions:
you're using a custom report generated by acipayments 
the data to be written is formatted as the results of a query to the access database
both files must be CSVs

How to generate the custom report:
Tab: General
	Transaction Type: All Transactions
Tab: Advance Filters
	Select Field: Transaction Types
	Select Operator: Is
	Select Value: Payments
Tab: Output Columns
	Original Confirmation #
	First name
	Last/Business Name
	Address Line 1
	Address Line 2
	City
	State
	Zip
	Country Code
	Base Payment Amount
	Consumer Fee
	Total Amount
	Routing/CC Auth
	Client Fee
	Partner Fee
	Terminal ID
	Application Label
	AID
	Entry Method
	CVM

Do NOT add/remove output columns, or change their ordering

Run it with the dates you're looking for in range (I do transaction time but the other one 
should work too)
